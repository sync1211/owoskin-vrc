# OWO VRChat integration

Yet another VRChat integration for the [OWO Skin](https://owogame.com/).

// Screenshots go here! (UI is still WIP)

## Features
* Velocity-based wind simulation (no setup required!)
* Collider feedback (similar to [Shadorki's OWO integration](https://github.com/shadorki/vrc-owo-suit))
* Velocity-based collider feedback
* Custom sensations triggered via OSC

## Avatar setup

Required for collider-based effects.

Import the `OWO_Suit.unitypackage` file from the `Unity` folder, as well as [VRCFury](https://vrcfury.com/).
Then simply align the colliders with your avatar and you're done!
